## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The hardest problem I face while making this app was making the settings portion. I was unsure how to use NSUserDefaults to connect the two view controllers nor did I know which methods did the codes go in. It took a lot of tweaking and online tutorials before I finally understood what to do. Afterwards, NSUSerDefaults became very easy to me and I was able to use it to create the theme changing switch.
